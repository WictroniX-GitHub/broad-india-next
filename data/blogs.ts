The broad industry has long been criticized for its exploitative practices, including low pay and long wait times for services. Many workers in the industry feel undervalued and overworked, leading to high turnover rates and dissatisfaction. 

To address these issues, industry leaders must prioritize fair wages and reasonable working hours. Additionally, improving efficiency and reducing wait times for customers can lead to a more positive experience for both employees and clients.

Change is necessary for the sustainability and growth of the industry. By taking steps to improve working conditions and customer satisfaction, the broad industry can create a more equitable and thriving environment for all involved.
